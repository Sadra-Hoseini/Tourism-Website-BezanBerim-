# BezanBerim


BezanBerim is a simple Persian tourism website, which I made on my own to improve my resume.

My idea was that tourism agencies be able to post their tours on this website and customers register for the desired tours.
In this project I used ready-made templates for the front-end part and Django,Python and Mysql for the back-end part.
I also created a basic api for this project using django rest framework.
